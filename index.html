            <h2>The DogsTrust “A dog is for life, not just for Christmas” campaign attempts to raise awareness to dogs bought thoughtlessly at Christmas, only to be returned within the next few months. But the heart of the problem might be far more complex.</h2>
            <p>When over 1,700 dogs were brought into DogsTrust shelters after boxing day, the charity named 2016 the “Year of the Unwanted Dog.” </p>

</p>The charity coined the phrase “A dog is for life, not just for Christmas” 38 years ago. And while the time since the slogan’s introduction has shown a decrease in animals being brought in, DogsTrust still sees a spike in the number of surrendered dogs after the holidays.</p>

As part of their 2017 campaign, DogsTrust produced several videos highlighting some of the more “shocking” reasons animals had been returned or abandoned at one of their shelters. The series, called “Why I left you” features reasons for dogs being returned such as “she was too friendly” and “he was panting too much," as well as “I’m a vegetarian but he always wanted to eat meat.”

            <p>Though seemingly hyperbolic, each video is based off of real calls to DogsTrust from people looking to give up their dogs.</p>

            <p>The animals surrendered to DogsTrust shelters in the months from January to March are often dogs or puppies which were bought as Christmas or holiday gifts.

</p> Phil Hammond is a Canine Carer at DogsTrust’s Ilfracombe centre in North Devon. He reported that since New Year’s, his centre had received two dogs but were expecting more. Both dogs were still young puppies, and both were bought as Christmas presents. </p>

<p> One bulldog puppy was returned because the children it was bought for had never been around dogs before and were fearful of the animal. The other, a weimaraner puppy, was returned when it’s “puppy behaviour” was more than the family that bought it could handle.</p>

</p>“I’d say behaviour is probably the number one reason for dogs coming to us,” Phil explained. “We find a lot of the reasons people give up their dogs could probably be worked on if they gave it a bit more time, whether it’s training classes or taking advice from us. But a lot of people aren’t willing to put that work in, so they give the dog up.” </p>

</p> DogsTrust data shows that behaviour does indeed make up a large percentage of the reasons a dog is brought in or surrendered to a DogsTrust shelter. Almost 30% of the reasons for a dog’s stay pertain to behaviour issues—including aggression, puppy traits, and barking.</p>

            <h2>The real problem </h2>
            <p> Overall, the return of Christmas puppies seems to be a consequence of an overarching problem that occurs throughout the entire year.</p>

</p>Shelters across the country see people return a dog they purchased only to realise it was more than they could handle. According to Phil, this turns into a constant issue for DogsTrust and other animal charities.</p>

</p>“In terms of Christmas, there is a spike but it’s part of a wider problem.  It’s constant with dogs trust the amount of dogs that are just given up and living in rescue,” said Phil. “Irresponsible dog ownership, breeding, and puppy smuggling are the three things that make the dog rescue problem so bad in this country.” </p>

</p> Puppy smuggling occurs when breeders from outside the UK bring in litters of “designer” dog breeds and sell them within the country. The puppies in these litters are often separated from their mother when they’re too young (apparently so that they’re smaller, and cuter in appearance), and often lack vaccines which poses a serious health risk to the puppy and other animals.</p>
<blockquote>
  “ Pups are separated from their mothers when they are weeks old because they look smaller and cuter, and can be sold for lots of money, especially in the weeks before Christmas. <br> ~ <em> DogsTrust</em>
</blockquote>
            <p>
              But a first-time pet owner might not know the risks of puppy smuggling. According to DogsTrust, a breeder’s website often shows pictures of healthy-looking puppies, and may even include some information about the parents that makes the sale seem legitimate.

<p> According to Phil, puppy smuggling has posed a real problem for dog charities. From year to year there are various popular breeds and people can always find a seller online. Most buyers don’t think to check if the mother is healthy or if the dog has the appropriate vaccines.

</p>“Dogs are so readily available to buy online at the click of button,” Phil explained. “People aren’t aware of bad breeding or puppy smuggling, they just see the cute photo and want to buy it.”</p>

</p> This also means that people can purchase puppies without considering the responsibility of raising a puppy, or the behaviour traits it might develop as it grows up. </p>

</p> Phil says: “I don’t think they think of the work that’s going to have to be put in for a puppy.” </p>

</p> Puppy smuggling has presented a similar issue for smaller animal welfare services as well. Su and June Roberts run the Sheffield branch of Labrador Welfare—an agency that rehomes abandoned Labradors of all ages. </p>

</p>Su agrees that people surrendering their animals is not just an annual problem but an ongoing issue for dog rescue in the UK. Because while Labrador Welfare does often have a rush in intake around the holidays, they deal with animals being abandoned all through the year.</p>

</p>“It’s not just at Christmas,” Su says, “It’s at summer too…anytime people go on holiday…anytime people decide they can’t take care of their dog anymore.” </p>

</p> She agreed that the presence of online sites does complicate things for dog rehoming. Because sometimes a smuggler or breeder may not full disclose an animal’s history.</p>

</p>“Through Labrador Welfare you have a full history,” said Su. “And the medical history can be very important.” </p>

</p>Su also say that they try to educate people on the breed traits of Labradors, as a common issue is people not being ready for the size the animals grow to or the energy they might have. But when they’re looking at a small, fluffy puppy Su says: “the heart rules the head.” </p>

            <h2> Pamela and Lolita </h2>

            <p>Pamela Molaschi of Lausanne, Switzerland admits that she wasn’t sure what to expect when she and her husband got their 10-year-old daughter a puppy in 2012. Neither of them had grown up with dogs, but a strange twist of fate led them to promising their daughter she could get a puppy.</p>

</p>“We were on holiday in the Maldives when there was a tsunami alert and we found ourselves on a boat out at sea waiting to see if the tsunami would appear,” Pamela said. “I told my daughter, while we were waiting and as darkness fell, that then might be a good time to ask her dad if she could have one of the babysitter's puppies.”</p>

</p> Their daughter’s babysitter was a dog breeder, and had a new litter of Yorkshire terrier puppies. This was a breed that Pamela said she felt comfortable with, as they didn’t shed and she found them cute “unlike some other breeds.”</p>

</p>However quite soon after bringing “Lolita” home, Pamela said she knew they couldn’t keep the dog. When their daughter lost interest in the puppy, Pamela felt the animal was quite dependent on her for attention and play. She found herself tied to the house, not wanting to leave Lolita alone for too long but not be able bring her places with her. She also found herself “out of place” at the vet, and at the animal food section of the supermarket.</p>

<p>Overall, Pamela felt like she was not cut out for dog ownership. Though the animal was cute and truly didn’t shed, she hadn’t been prepared for some of the medical issues or behavioural traits the dog developed. She knew they absolutely had to give Lolita up when the dog tried to bring the “bloody remains” of an animal she’d killed into the house. Pamela described it as a “crime scene.”</p>

</p>“[Lolita] seemed unhappy with us and we didn't manage to make much of a connection,” Pamela said. “I knew she'd be better off in a family which was used to having pets, unlike us.” </p>

</p> Luckily for Lolita, Pamela met a woman at a church coffee morning who already owned two Yorkshire terriers. When she found out Pamela was interested in rehoming Lolita, she expressed interest and ended up taking her home that same day. According to Pamela, it ended up being a “perfect fit.” </p>

<p>
<h2> The True Stastic </h2>
<p>

<p>Unfortunately, not all animals are as fortunate as Lolita. For most, the rehoming process is not instantaneous, leaving some dogs in shelters for months or even years.</p>

</p>At DogsTrust, the average stay for an animal is about two weeks. This statistic is skewed by an “8 day statuatory” stay: a mandatory weeklong assessment period for each incoming dog. </p>

            <p>During the assessment time, all dogs are assessed on how they react with people, children, and other animals to see what kind of home would best suit each animal.</p>
</p>People interested in adopting a shelter dog fill out a corresponding questionnaire. Based on this information, people are matched with a dog best suited for their lives, and dogs are matched with the best home. </p>

</p>“Once their assessment period is done we try to get them out as quick as we can,” explained Phil. “So a lot of them are gone by 10 days, and that brings the average down.” </p>

</p>Many animals lay outside of this statistic, remaining at the shelters far past the 15-day average. According to Phil, this is often due to behavioural issues or the age of the dog. Some dogs are not ready for rehoming within the “average” time, but it doesn’t mean they can never be rehomed. </p>

</p>He says there is often a misconception that a shelter dog is “broken” and that it will be harder to take care of then a puppy. But the reality, both will have different issues when it comes to rehoming, so it’s up to owner to take the time for training. </p>

<h2> Years to come </h2>

<p> As the numbers of animals bought around Christmas decrease, shelters around the country still face many problems for dog rescue.</p>

</p>It is hoped that with Brexit, DogsTrust will be able to introduce laws to diminish or eradicate puppy smuggling. </p>

</p>DogsTrust also offers “Dogs Trust Dog School,” which includes training programs and online tutorials for puppy and adult dogs. The RSPCA website also offers tips on how to find your own dog trainer or training class for a dog of any age. </p>

</p>With a combination of awareness, law, and owner effort, DogsTrust hopes to continue to see a decline in surrendered dogs, and an increase in people willing to adopt shelter dogs. </p>

<p> Headline: Ava (left): Kelpie cross. She was handed in at a very young age (just a few months old) because her owners could not cope with her behaviour. She stayed with the shelter for just 2 weeks before going out to a home where she remains today. Rosie (right): Pointer cross. She was handed in because of a relationship breakdown, she was with the shelter for just 2 weeks before going out to a new home where she remains today. </p>
